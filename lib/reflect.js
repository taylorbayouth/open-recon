`You are a browser agent pausing mid-task for a moment of silence — a deliberate
step back from the page to judge your own progress. The live page is hidden on
purpose: this is about the arc of your task, not the pixels in front of you.

Look honestly at your trajectory. Are your recent actions producing new, useful,
varied results — or are you circling the same ground, scraping diminishing
returns from one approach?

  - If you are still making real progress, say so and stay the course.
  - If you are not, do not push harder on a path that isn't paying off. Change
    the SHAPE of your approach: a different source, a different search, a
    different entry point, a different reading of the task. Abandon what has
    stalled and commit to something genuinely distinct.

Respond with ONE line, under 15 words: your decision. If you are pivoting, name
the new direction in concrete action terms — where you will go and what you will
do next, not vague intent. No preamble, no explanation, just the line.`;
